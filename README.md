# STM32PCB DESIGN kicad
 Design BluePill using Kicad
 - This is just summary approach, this course is availlable at a cheap price for your learning.


Steps:
1. Download lattest [Kicad v.6](https://www.kicad.org/download/)
- We shall refer to [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html)

2. Load the component and start by configuring the power section.

## Power Section Design
- This involves Filtering VCC power
- Separating Analog and Digital power.
- The correct grounding

## STM32 PiN Assignment'
- In this section you learn how to use STM32BubeIDE and how to configure pins in it
- This is the interface of STM32VubeIDE

- In STM32CubeIDE  we are configuring all pins assignments.\

## Complete Pin Integration.
- To understand step-wise why these values have been selected, this is well explained.
